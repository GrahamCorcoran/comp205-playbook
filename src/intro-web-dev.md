# Introduction to Web Development

In this course, we will be exploring the basics of web development, and learning how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build basic web pages.

## What is Web Development?

Web Development is a sub-set of development which focuses on building software that is interacted with through the internet. This can be as simple as a basic web page with static text (like this book!) or as complicated as the backbone of an entire business, for example for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application.

### Types of Web Development

Web Development is often broken down into different categories, including:
- **Frontend Development** - Which focuses on what the user sees and interacts with, often written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend Development** - Development focusing on the "brains" of a site that handles more application logic. Backend development is written in many languages, including JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and more.
- **Full Stack Development** - Typically refers to developers who work across the "stack", both in the backend and the frontend.
- **Infrastructure, Site Reliability Engineering, DevOps** - This form of development focuses on the hosting and serving of applications, typically around maintaining a high-quality end-user experience and minimizing downtime.

## The "Average Day" of a Web Developer
Web Developer roles vary widely, so an average day is hard to define. It's common for a web developer to spend slightly more than half of their day actually doing programming, with other time dedicated to meetings, understanding requirements, or assisting their coworkers. An excellent web developer is one who is capable both with technical skills, and co-operating with others.
