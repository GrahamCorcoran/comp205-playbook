<h1>Welcome to COMP205!</h1>

In COMP205, we are learning to use HTML to create web pages and link multiple web pages together. We will also learn how to control the layout and style of web pages using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and to make web pages interactive using JavaScript.

## About Your Professor

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Graham! I'm a St. Lawrence College graduate, and I work in the industry as an Engineering Manager. I have two cats and a dog, and I really enjoy teaching!

I got drawn to programming as the logical thinking and problem-solving required really works well for my brain, and I find it incredibly satisfying to finally crack a sneaky bug.
