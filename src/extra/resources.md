## Resources
| Link | Description |
|---------|---------|
| [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) | Information on Web Development basics as compiled by the Mozilla foundation. |
| [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) | w3schools provides resources on HTML that tend to be slightly more accessible than MDN Web Docs. I recommend referring to MDN Web Docs first, but use w3schools to help solidify understanding. |
| [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) | VSCode is a code editor which we will be using in this course. If you prefer a different editor or IDE you are free to use that as well, but I will only provide support for VSCode. |
