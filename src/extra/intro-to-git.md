# Introduction to Git
Git is a [version control system](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) (VCS) which allows you to handle changes to code over time. The key difference between a VCS and just saving your file is that a VCS will allow you to "go back in time" and edit things in the past, whereas saving only usually allows you to go back to the last time you saved.

```admonish note title="Installing Git"
During the installation of git, you can generally follow the defaults. However, when it asks you to select a text editor, you should *not* use the default suggestion of Vim unless you know what you're doing. Select another program such as Notepad++.

To install git, follow the instructions on [Git SCM's Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) guide.

When you have finished installing, you should restart your terminal to ensure the changes take effect.

## What is a commit?
A commit is a version of your code at a single point in time. The way git handles commits is by tracking *changes*, so your commits can be thought of as a series of changes over time. 

| Commit # | Addition                | Deletion | Total File                         |
|----------|-------------------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| 1        | Hello World             |          | Hello World                        |
| 2        | , my name is John Smith |          | Hello World, my name is John Smith |
| 3        | Doe                     | Smith    | Hello World, my name is John Doe   |
