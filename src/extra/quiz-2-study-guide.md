# Quiz 2 Study Guide

The first quiz of the course will include any content we covered in weeks 4-6. You can review details of what that was on the following pages:
- [Introduction to Specific Elements](../module_1/headings-lists-tables.md)
- [Interactive Elements](../module_1/interactive-elements.md)

You may also want to refer to the [HTML Elements Reference](../module_1/elements-reference.md) to ensure you're comfortable answering questions about elements we've covered so far. Lastly, you likely want to briefly review sections 1.1 through 1.3, as much of the content builds upon earlier content in this course.
